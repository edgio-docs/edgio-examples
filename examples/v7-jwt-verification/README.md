https://edgio-community-examples-v7-jwt-verification-test.glb.edgio.link/

## Description

This repository provides example code for verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using Edge Functions. It features an example of how to verify a JWT and return a 401 response if the token is invalid.

## Prerequisites

**NOTE**: To use this project, you must be an Edgio customer and signed up for the Edge Functions. See our [Edge Functions documentation](https://docs.edg.io/guides/v7/edge-functions) for information on activating this feature.

The system requirements include Node.js v16 or higher, and a UNIX-like system (Linux or macOS). The project code is written in JavaScript.

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure you meet the prerequisites.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run `npm install` in the repository directory.

## Getting Started

After setting up the project, run `npm run edgio:dev` to start a local development server to test the example functions.

To deploy the project to Edgio, use the command `npm run edgio:deploy`. Note that deployment to Edgio requires you to be
logged into Edgio CLI which can be done via `npm run edgio login` and following the instructions.

## Known Issues and Limitations

Currently

* We only support JavaScript-based code
* Each request has a 60-second (wall time) timeout limit
* Each request is limited to 50ms of CPU time
* Each request is limited to 2MB of memory
* An Edgio Function can make fetch requests only to origins defined in your property configuration
  file (`edgio.config.js`).

We're looking forward to feedback from our customers about these limitations and how we can improve the product.
