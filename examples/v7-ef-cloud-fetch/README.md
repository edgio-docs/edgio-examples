https://edgio-community-examples-v7-ef-cloud-fetch-live.glb.edgio.link/

## Description

This example demonstrates how to use Edgio to [fetch from cloud functions](https://docs.edg.io/guides/v7/edge-functions#fetching-from-cloud-functions), enabling personalization of the Next.js server response at the edge.

## Setup and Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` in the repository directory.

## Getting Started

After setting up the project, run `npm run edgio:dev` to start a local development server to test the example functions.

To deploy the project to Edgio, use the command `npm run edgio:deploy`. Note that deployment to Edgio requires you to be
logged into Edgio CLI which can be done via `npm run edgio login` and following the instructions.

## Support

If you have any queries or face issues with this project, please don't hesitate to contact
the [Edgio team](https://edg.io/contact-support/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
