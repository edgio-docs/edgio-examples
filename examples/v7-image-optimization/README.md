# Edgio Image Optimization Examples

https://edgio-community-examples-v7-image-optimization-live.glb.edgio.link

## Description

Edgio's [image optimization](https://docs.edg.io/guides/v7/performance/image_optimization) feature can dynamically alter images to fit a site's design, experience, and performance needs, by applying transformations like resizing, blurring, or cropping based on the site's requirements. For instance, it can blur images beyond a visitor's free access limit on a paywalled site. It enhances performance by caching the transformed images at the network edge, reducing image processing time and delivering optimized images nearer to users.
